#USAGE

Uses a basic genetic algorithm strategy to reach evolve towards a target string


For crossover at a certain point
    
    python main.py --string=awesome


# OUTPUT
    Generation = 1
    Fittest gene = wsWqYlJtuJs
    Generation = 2
    Fittest gene = wsWqYqhzbvH
    Generation = 3
    Fittest gene = wsWqYqhzbvH
    Generation = 4
    Fittest gene = wsWqnqhzbvH
    Generation = 5
    Fittest gene = nsWqnqhzbvH

    ...

    Generation = 175
    Fittest gene = axesomeness
    Generation = 176
    Fittest gene = axesomeness

    Fittest gene = axesomeness
    Generation = 178
    Fittest gene = axesomeness
    Generation = 179
    Fittest gene = awesomeness

    TARGET REACHED AFTER 179 GENERATIONS!!!
